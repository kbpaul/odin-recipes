    <p>Delicious Classic Risotto</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>4 c.</strong> store-bought or homemade low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li><strong>5 tbsp.</strong> unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> medium white onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 c.)</li>
        <li><strong>2 1/2 tsp.</strong> kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 c.</strong> arborio or carnaroli rice</li>
        <li><strong>1 c.</strong> dry white wine</li>
        <li><strong>3 oz.</strong> Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 1/2 c.) </li>
        <li><strong>3/4 tsp.</strong> freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot over medium-high heat, heat broth until
             steaming. Reduce heat to low, cover, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, melt 4
             tablespoons butter. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and
              cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, translucent,
               and sweet to the taste, 8 to 10 minutes. Add rice and
                cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent around
                 the edges, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add wine and cook, stirring, until liquid is absorbed,
             3 to 4 minutes. Add 3 cups warm broth, stir to incorporate,
              and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to
               medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is just tender,
                10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and add 1/2 cup warm broth. Return to a simmer over
             medium heat and continue to cook, stirring, until broth is
              absorbed, 1 to 2 minutes more. Taste and, if rice is still
               slightly al dente, add remaining 1/2 cup broth and continue to
             simmer, stirring, until absorbed and rice is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan, pepper, and remaining
             1 tablespoon butter until cheese and butter are melted;
              season with remaining 2 teaspoons salt, if
             needed. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
